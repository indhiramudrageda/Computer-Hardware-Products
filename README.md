The purpose of this project was to create a website using the languages and tools that we learned over the course of this semester. We were given a list of possible options within the scope of the e-commerce domain. Our team chose to create an e-commerce website for a Computer Parts store. The project got challenging as we delved into complex implementations and gave us the opportunity of learning new sets of techniques. We were provided with a set of requirements that we were supposed to adhere to.

Technologies Used: Node.js, Express Framework, HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, MongoDB
